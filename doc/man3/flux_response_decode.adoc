NAME
----
flux_response_decode, flux_response_decode_raw - decode a Flux response message


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 int flux_response_decode (const flux_msg_t *msg,
                           const char **topic,
                           const char **json_str);

 int flux_response_decode_raw (const flux_msg_t *msg,
                               const char **topic,
                               const void **data, int *len);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_response_decode()` decodes a response message _msg_.

_topic_, if non-NULL, will be set to the message's topic string. The
storage for this string belongs to _msg_ and should not be freed.

_json_str_, if non-NULL, will be set to the message's JSON payload.
If no payload exists, _json_str_ is set to NULL.  The storage for this
string belongs to _msg_ and should not be freed.

`flux_response_decode_raw()` decodes a response message with a raw payload,
setting _data_ and _len_ to the payload data and length. The storage for
the raw payload belongs to _msg_ and should not be freed.


RETURN VALUE
------------

These functions return 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
The _msg_ argument was NULL.

EPROTO::
Message decoding failed, such as due to incorrect message type,
missing topic string, etc..
