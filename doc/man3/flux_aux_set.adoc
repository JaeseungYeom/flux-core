SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

typedef void (*flux_free_f)(void *arg);

void *flux_aux_get (flux_t *h, const char *name);

void flux_aux_set (flux_t *h, const char *name, void *aux, flux_free_f destroy);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_aux_set()` stores application-specific data _aux_ in handle
_h_ under the key _name_ with destructor _destroy_.  If _destroy_
is non-NULL, the destructor is called at `flux_close()` or when
_name_ is overwritten by another `flux_aux_set()` call.

`flux_aux_get()` can be used to retrieve the data by _name_.

Names beginning with "flux::" are reserved for internal use by libflux-core.

RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_aux_get()` returns  data on success, or NULL on failure.
It does not set errno.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
