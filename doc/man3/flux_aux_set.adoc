:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux_aux_set, flux_aux_get - get/set auxiliary handle data


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 typedef void (*flux_free_f)(void *arg);

 void *flux_aux_get (flux_t *h, const char *name);

 int flux_aux_set (flux_t *h, const char *name,
                   void *aux, flux_free_f destroy);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_aux_set()` attaches application-specific data
to the parent object _h_.  It stores data _aux_ by key _name_,
with optional destructor _destroy_.  The destructor, if non-NULL,
is called when the parent object is destroyed, or when
_key_ is overwritten by a new value.  If _aux_ is NULL,
the destructor for a previous value, if any is called,
 but no new value is stored.  If _name_ is NULL,
_aux_ is stored anonymously.

`flux_aux_get()` retrieves application-specific data
by _name_.  If the data was stored anonymously, it
cannot be retrieved.

Names beginning with "flux::" are reserved for internal use.

RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_aux_get()` returns data on success, or NULL on failure, with errno set.

`flux_aux_set()` returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure, with errno set.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.

ENOENT::
`flux_aux_get()` could not find an entry for _key_.
