NAME
----
flux_respond, flux_respond_raw - respond to a request


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 int flux_respond (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *request,
                   int errnum, const char *json_str);

 int flux_respond_raw (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *request,
                       int errnum, const void *data, int length);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_respond()` and `flux_respond_raw()` encode and send a response
message on handle _h_, deriving topic string, matchtag, and route stack
from the provided _request_.

If _errnum_ is non-zero, an error is returned to the sender such that
`flux_rpc_get(3)` or `flux_rpc_get_raw(3)` will fail, with the system
errno set to _errnum_.  Any payload arguments are ignored in this case.

If _json_str_ is non-NULL, `flux_respond()` will send it as the response
payload, otherwise there will be no payload.  Similarly, if _data_ is
non-NULL, `flux_respond_raw()` will send it as the response payload.


RETURN VALUE
------------

These functions return zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

ENOSYS::
Handle has no send operation.

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

EPROTO::
A protocol error was encountered.
