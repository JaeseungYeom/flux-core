NAME
----
flux_rpc_raw, flux_rpc_get_raw - perform a remote procedure call to a Flux service using raw payloads


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 flux_rpc_t *flux_rpc_raw (flux_t *h, const char *topic,
                           const void *data_in, int length_in,
                           uint32_t nodeid_in, int flags);

 int flux_rpc_get_raw (flux_rpc_t *rpc, void *data_out, int *length_out);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_rpc_raw()` and `flux_rpc_get_raw()` are analogs of the JSON RPC
functions `flux_rpc()` and `flux_rpc_get()` that deal in opaque payloads.
These functions may be intermixed;  that is, it is valid to send
a JSON request payload and receive a raw response payload, or the reverse.

_topic_ must be set to a topic string representing the Flux
service that will handle the request.

_data_in_, if non-NULL, points to a payload of size _length_in_.
If NULL, the request will be sent without a payload.

_nodeid_in_ affects request routing, and must be set to one of the following
values:

FLUX_NODEID_ANY::
The request is routed to the first matching service instance.

FLUX_NODEID_UPSTREAM::
The request is routed to the first matching service instance,
skipping over the sending rank.

integer::
The request is routed to a specific rank.

_flags_ may be zero or:

FLUX_RPC_NORESPONSE::
No response is expected.  The request will not be assigned a matchtag,
and the flux_rpc_t returned by `flux_rpc()` may be immediately destroyed.

`flux_rpc_get_raw()` blocks until a matching response is received, then
decodes the result.  For asynchronous response handling, see flux_rpc_then(3).

_data_out_ and _length_out_, which must be non-NULL, are assigned a pointer
to the response payload and its length.  If there is no response payload,
they will be sent to NULL and zero, respectively.  Any storage associated
with _data_out_ belongs to the flux_rpc_t object and is invalidated when
that object is destroyed.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_rpc_raw()` returns a flux_rpc_t object on success.  On error, NULL
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_rpc_get_raw()` returns zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

ENOSYS::
Handle has no send operation.

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

EPROTO::
A protocol error was encountered.
