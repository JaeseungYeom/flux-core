flux_event_decode, flux_event_decodef, flux_event_encode, flux_event_encodef 
 - encode/decode a Flux event message


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 int flux_event_decode (const flux_msg_t *msg,
                        const char **topic,
                        const char **json_str);

 int flux_event_decodef (const flux_msg_t *msg,
                         const char **topic,
                         const char *fmt, ...);

 flux_msg_t *flux_event_encode (const char *topic,
                                const char *json_str);

 flux_msg_t *flux_event_encodef (const char *topic,
                                 const char *fmt, ...);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_event_decode()` decodes a Flux event message _msg_.

_topic_, if non-NULL, will be set the message's topic string. The storage
for this string belongs to _msg_ and should not be freed.

_json_str_, if non-NULL, will be set to the message's JSON payload. If
no payload exists, _json_str_ is set to NULL.  The storage for this
string belongs to _msg_ and should not be freed.

`flux_event_decodef()` decodes a Flux event message with a JSON payload as
above, parsing the payload using variable arguments with a format string
in the style of jansson's `json_unpack()` (used internally). Decoding fails
if the message doesn't have a JSON payload.

`flux_event_encode()` encodes a Flux event message with topic string _topic_
and optional JSON payload _json_str_.  The newly constructed message that
is returned must be destroyed with `flux_msg_destroy()`.

`flux_event_encodef()` encodes a Flux event message with a JSON payload as
above, encoding the payload using variable arguments with a format string
in the style of jansson's `json_unpack()` (used internally). Decoding fails
if the message doesn't have a JSON payload.

Events propagated to all subscribers.  Events will not be received
without a matching subscription established using `flux_event_subscribe()`.

RETURN VALUE
------------

Decoding functions return 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.

Encoding functions return a message on success.  On error, NULL is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
The _msg_ argument was NULL or there was a problem encoding.

ENOMEM::
Memory was unavailable.

EPROTO::
Message decoding failed, such as due to missing or unexpected payload,
incorrect message type, missing topic string, etc..
