flux_rpc_then(3)

NAME
----
flux_rpc_check, flux_rpc_then - asynchronous RPC interface


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

typedef void (*flux_then_f)(flux_rpc_t *rpc, void *arg);

bool flux_rpc_check (flux_rpc_t *rpc);

int flux_rpc_then (flux_rpc_t *rpc, flux_then_f cb, void *arg);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_rpc_check()` and `flux_rpc_then()` may be used to asynchronously
complete the second half of a remote procedure call (RPC) that was
started with one of the `flux_rpc(3)` variants.

`flux_rpc_check()` returns true if the RPC response has been received
and a call to one of the `flux_rpc_get(3)` variants would not block.
It returns false if the response has not yet been received.

`flux_rpc_then()` may be used to register a continuation callback with
the broker handle's reactor.  The continuation will be called when the
RPC response is received.  It should call one of the `flux_rpc_get(3)`
variants to obtain the RPC result.

When the RPC is complete, the continuation stops its message handler
for responses.  The flux_rpc_t should be destroyed.  It is safe to
call `flux_rpc_destroy(3)` from within the continuation callback.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_rpc_then()` returns  zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_rpc_check()` does not report errors.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.


EXAMPLES
--------

This example performs an RPC with the broker's "cmb.attrget" service
to obtain the broker's rank.  If the response is available immediately,
it is processed synchronously.  Otherwise, a continuation is registered to
process the response when it arrives, meanwhile allowing other reactor
watchers (not shown) to execute.
