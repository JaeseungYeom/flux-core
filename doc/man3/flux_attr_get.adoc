NAME
----
flux_attr_get, flux_attr_set, flux_attr_first, flux_attr_next - query Flux broker attributes


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

const char *flux_attr_get (flux_t *h, const char *name, int *flags);

int flux_attr_set (flux_t *h, const char *name, const char *val);

const char *flux_attr_first (flux_t *h);

const char *flux_attr_next (flux_t *h);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Flux broker attributes are both a simple, general-purpose key-value
store with scope limited to the local broker rank, and a method for the
broker to export information needed by Flux comms modules and utilities.

`flux_attr_get()` retrieves the value of the attribute _name_.
If _flags_ is non-NULL, the flags associated with the attribute are
stored there.  Flags are a mask of the following bit values:

FLUX_ATTRFLAG_IMMUTABLE::
The value of this attribute will never change.  It can be cached indefinitely.

FLUX_ATTRFLAG_READONLY::
The value of this attribute cannot be changed with `flux_attr_set()`,
however it may change on the broker and should not be cached.

FLUX_ATTRFLAG_ACTIVE::
Getting or setting this attribute may have side effects in the broker.
For example, retrieving the "snoop-uri" attribute triggers the creation
of the snoop socket by the broker on the first call.

Attributes that have the FLUX_ATTRFLAG_IMMUTABLE flag are cached automatically
in the flux_t handle.  For example, the "rank" attribute is a frequently
accessed attribute whose value never changes.  It will be cached on the first
access and thereafter does not require an RPC to the broker to access.

`flux_attr_set()` updates the value of attribute _name_ to _val_.
If _name_ is not currently a valid attribute, it is created.
Attributes created through this interface will have no flags set.
If _val_ is NULL, the attribute is unset.

`flux_attr_first()` and `flux_attr_next()` are used to iterate
through the current set of valid attribute names.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_attr_get()` returns the requested value on success.  On error, NULL
is returned and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_attr_set()` returns zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned
and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_attr_first()` and `flux_attr_next()` return an attribute name or
NULL to indicate that iteration is complete.


ERRORS
------

ENOENT::
The requested attribute is invalid or has a NULL value on the broker.

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

EPERM::
Set was attempted on an attribute with the FLUX_ATTR_IMMUTABLE or
FLUX_ATTR_READONLY flags.
