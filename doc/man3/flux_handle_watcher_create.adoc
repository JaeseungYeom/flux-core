NAME

flux_handle_watcher_create, flux_handle_watcher_get_flux -  create broker handle watcher


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 typedef void (*flux_watcher_f)(flux_reactor_t *r,
                                flux_watcher_t *w,
                                int revents, void *arg);

 flux_watcher_t *flux_handle_watcher_create (flux_reactor_t *r,
                                             flux_t *h, int events,
                                             flux_watcher_f callback,
                                             void *arg);

 flux_t *flux_handle_watcher_get_flux (flux_watcher_t *w);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_handle_watcher_create()` creates a flux_watcher_t object which
monitors for events on a Flux broker handle _h_.  When events occur,
the user-supplied _callback_ is invoked.

The _events_ and _revents_ arguments are a bitmask containing a
logical ``or'' of the following bits.  If a bit is set in _events_,
it indicates interest in this type of event.  If a bit is set in _revents_,
it indicates that this event has occurred.

FLUX_POLLIN::
The handle is ready for reading.

FLUX_POLLOUT::
The handle is ready for writing.

FLUX_POLLERR::
The handle has encountered an error.
This bit is ignored if it is set in _events_.

Events are processed in a level-triggered manner.  That is, the
callback will continue to be invoked as long as the event has not been
fully consumed or cleared, and the watcher has not been stopped.

`flux_handle_watcher_get_flux()` is used to obtain the handle from
within the callback.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_handle_watcher_create()` returns a flux_watcher_t object on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_handle_watcher_get_flux()` returns the handle associated with
the watcher.


ERRORS
------

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
