:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-hostlist - List hostnames for flux instances or jobs


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *hostlist* [--compressed] [JOBIDS]...
*flux* *hostlist* [--set]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'flux hostlist' prints a list of hostnames on stdout for the current
instance or for a set of 'JOBIDS'.

Without any arguments 'flux hostlist' will attempt to read the list
of hostnames, one per rank, from the 'resource.hosts' key in the kvs,
and falls back to 'flux exec hostname' if the key is not found.

If an optional list of 'JOBIDS' is provided as an argument to the
command the list emitted is the union of hosts in all 'JOBIDS'.

OPTIONS
-------

*-c, --compressed*::
Output hostname list in compressed format, e.g. 'host[1-10]' instead
of individual hostnames, one pre line.

*-r, --ranks*::
Output rank ids instead of hostnames.

*--set*::
This option is used to set the initial value for the 'resource.hosts'
key from a file or list of hostnames on stdin. It is not meant for
general use, but it is used by the Flux init system.
