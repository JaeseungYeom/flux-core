--ntasks='ntasks'::
-n 'ntasks'::
	Request to run a total of 'ntasks' tasks. If '--ntasks' is used alone,
	i.e. without '--nnodes', then 'flux wreckrun' will attempt to
	distribute the 'ntasks' tasks across all nodes of the Flux comms
	session.

--cores-per-task='N'::
-c 'N'::
	Request N cores be allocated to each task.

--gpus-per-task='N'::
-g 'N'::
	Request N GPUs be allocated to each task.

--nnodes='nnodes'::
-N 'nnodes'::
	Request to run across 'nnodes' nodes in the current comms session.
	
--tasks-per-node='tpn'::
-t 'tpn'::
	Set the number of tasks to run per node to 'tpn'. The default is
	--tasks-per-node=1. This value is overridden by '--ntasks' if used.

--label-io::
-l::
	Prepend stdout and stderr output lines with the task id to which
	the output belongs.

--output='FILENAME'::
-O 'FILENAME'::
	Duplicate stdout and stderr from tasks to a file or files. 'FILENAME'
	is optionally a mustache template which expands the keys 'id', 'cmd'
	and 'taskid'. (e.g. '--output=flux-{{id}}.out')

--error='FILENAME'::
-E 'FILENAME'::
	Send stderr to a different location than stdout.

--input='HOW'::
-i 'HOW'::
	Indicate how to deal with stdin for tasks. 'HOW' is a list of 'src:dst'
	pairs where 'src' is a source 'FILENAME' which may optionally be a
	mustache template as in `--output`, or the special term `stdin` to
	indicate the stdin from a front end program, and 'dst' is a list of
	taskids or `*` or `all` to indicate all tasks. The default is `stdin:*`.
	If only one of 'src' or 'dst' is specified, a heuristic is used to
	determine whether a list of tasks or an input file was meant. (e.g
	`--input=file.in` will use `file.in` as input for all tasks, and
	`--input=0` will send stdin to task 0 only.

--walltime='N[SUFFIX]'::
-T 'N[SUFFIX]'::
        Set max job walltime to N seconds. Optional suffix may be 's'
        for seconds (default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd'
        for days.  N may be an arbitrary floating point number, but
        will be rounded up to nearest second.

--skip-env::
-S::
	Skip the export of the local environment to the job.

--epilog='PATH'::
-x 'PATH'::
	Execute a script at 'PATH' after all tasks exit but before the
	job state is set to to 'complete' (So the job will not complete
	and the resources will not be released until the script ends)

--postscript='PATH'::
-p 'PATH'::
	Similar to '--epilog', but execute 'PATH' after job state is
	complete.

--options='options,...'::
-o 'options,...'::
	Apply extended job options to the current execution. Examples of
	these options are described in the xref:extra-options[].

--name='JOBNAME'::
-J 'JOBNAME'::
	Set an optional name to 'JOBNAME' for the submitted job. This name
	will be saved in the KVS record for the job and displayed in place
	of command name in `flux wreck ls` output.
